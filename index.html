            <p>I have always been fascinated by computers. I grew up in the 80s, and had limited access to computers as a child. Early PCs were finicky things, and my parents were afraid my brother or I would break the family computer if we were allowed to play with it.</p>

            <p>I did not have my own computer until I was much older. By that time, I felt that I was too old to learn programming, as most of my peers who were interested in studying coding in college had previous coding experience with code, either as a hobbyist or from attending a computer camp. Therefore, I had ruled out a career in IT, and instead pursued a liberal arts education.</p>
            <p>I am really excited to do LaunchCode, as being a professional programmer has always been a dream of mine. I am very greatful to have this opportunity to finally learn to code in a structured environment, having tried unsuccessfully to teach myself outside of a classroom.</p>
